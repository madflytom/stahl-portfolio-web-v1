                    </h2>
                    <div class="text-xl pt-4 lg:pt-0">
                        <p class="mb-8">I am a full-stack developer and team lead. I spend quite a bit of time in
                            meetings, quietly asking questions and drawing boxes
                            and arrows while people explain the problem they are trying to solve. A lot of times those
                            boxes and arrows turn into
                            components of a UI, a new method in a web service, or after several more conversations, an
                            entirely new app somewhere in
                            the portfolio.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-8">When I'm not in meetings with stakeholders, business analysts, or my team, I'm
                            usually enjoying smashing keys (lets be honest,
                            it's usually ctl + c and ctl + v), writing code to try to solve one of the problems I've
                            spent hours trying to understand. There is no more frustrating
                            moment in a developer's life than the 4 hours they spent trying to make one piece of logic
                            work. But you'll be hard-pressed to find the level of joy
                            you can get when that last compile actually succeeds, passes all the unit tests, and makes
                            someone's job easier. That's why I
                            have been in IT for over 15 years now. At the heart of it, there is a passion to serve
                            others.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-8">In my resume you'll find a lot of jobs, ranging from multimedia developer, COTS
                            application subject-matter-expert, IT architect, and technical lead.
                            Outside of work you'll find me volunteering for my local county health department, coaching
                            a youth lacrosse team, walking with my dog,
                            hiking with family and friends, or bouncing around between home maintenance projects that
                            never seem to end.
