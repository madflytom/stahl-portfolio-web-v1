# Tom Stahl Portfolio Website

This is a simple one-page website build with Tailwind.css and Locomotive Scroll.  I wanted to build a simple resume/portfolio site and really explore these two libraries and their uses.

### Inspiration

This project started with inspiration from George Martsoukos's Locomotive Scroll and Tailwind example here: https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/scrolling-website-with-locomotive-scroll-tailwind-css--cms-36943
